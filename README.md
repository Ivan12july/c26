Noodle soup, also known as: sopa de fideos, isn't exactly Mexico-specific. In fact, it's also a staple in regional Filipino, Spanish and Tex-mex cuisine. However, it is a commonly consumed, simple broth, often served as the starter course for fonda meals, a fonda being a restaurant in a family home, and comida corrida (affordably priced set meals). The noodles (vermicelli and angel hair pasta can also be used) tend to be broken up and browned before being added to the stock base.
